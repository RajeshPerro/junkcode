We had fun. Our math guy (Luis Carvajal) had a few issues at home so this
made things difficult for us. Also, only one team member could work full time.

# How did we do?

Our rank at freeze time was 70. A race about not being last :-P So we tried to send as many solutions as we could with a simple algorithm.
The algorithm only folds in halves to get a rectangle that encircles the silhouette.



We didn't get a geisha drone and it would have been very useful.
The math behind this problem is very interesting.

Unfortunately, there was a 1-line bug in the *smart* submitter that made us submit solutions for about half of the problems
and not for them all. Bummer!

## Simple algorithm performance (on average 21.64% for each problem).

In the following list we have : score, number of problems, percent of submissions.

# Code

- Problem creator (src/grid_generator_affine.py)
- Problem downloader (src/snapshot_sync.py)
- Solution submitter (src/solve_pending.py)
- Basic solver that only folds in halves to make rectangles (binary_solver.py)

And that was it. Thanks to the organizers. We need to study more math :-)

The submission system was impressive. Kudos to the organizers for this.
