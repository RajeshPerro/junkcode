This is an evolving project to explore the space of the 1-dimensional
r=2 cellular automata. I'm working a lot on this one.

 Random number generation with one-dimensional r=2 cellular automata

 Please tell me if you find any bug or have any suggestions.

CREDITS:

 * GALib

 I use the library GALib 2.4.6 by Matthew Wall.
 (Not anymore, but I the file ex20.C uses GALib).
 http://lancet.mit.edu/ga/

 I had trouble with GALib and I'm using about 0.1% of it. I wrote 
 a GA library in C.
 
 * diehardc

 I redistribute the DiehardC program version 1.03, September 9, 1998.
 From the source:

  * Note: This version of diehard was created by Scott Nelson,
  * working from the original DIEHARD code provided by George Marsaglia.

BUILDING

 $ ./gen.sh
 $ ./configure
 $ make


To make things faster you might use the IBM compiler on AIX (power5).

./configure CC=xlc CFLAGS="-qarch=pwr5 -qtune=pwr5 -qhot -O5" \
          --disable-debug --disable-efence


 If you want the program to be installed in your system
 $ make install

 The following options are available in the configure program

 --enable-debug          turn on debugging default=no
 --enable-warnings       turn on warnings default=yes
 --enable-pedantic       turn on pedantic default=yes
 --enable-efence         link against efence default=no
 --enable-profile        profiling          default=no

 Link again efence if you want to trace memory allocation
 problems.
             
Some of the best rules found by the genetic algorithm.
The score is computed by the script parse-diehard.pl.
The maximum score is 23.
