These programs operate on 1-dimensional r=2 cellular automata.


CAGRAPH : Generate graphs

  This program can be used to generate graphs with all states of the CA.

  To generate an image with this program using the rule 1687722855 and
  an automaton of size 7.

    $ ./cagraph 1687722855 7
    $ dot -Tpng graph-rule1687722855-n7.dot > rule1687722855-n7.png

  NOTE: The dot program is part of graphviz (http://www.graphviz.org).

CA-FINDCYCLES:

  This program prints the length of each cycle in CA.
  To generate all the cycles of the rule 1687722855
  using a size of 7.

  $ ./cafindcycles 1687722855 7
  2
  77
  14

  You can modify it to have it print more data. An starting state
  for each cycle, for instance.

SCRIPTS:

  * ca-cycle-stats.pl:

  I used this script to generate the file cycle-stats.txt. It allows us
  to use the following scripts to display nice graphics.

  * ca-findcycles-plot-stats.pl:

  ./ca-findcycles-plot-stats.pl cycle-stats.txt

  It should plot a nice graph using the data collected in the previous script.

  * ca-findcycles-print-max-rules.pl

  ./ca-findcycles-print-max-rules.pl cycle-stats.txt

  It should print the maximum cycle found for each CA size.

NOTES

  AIX:

  ./configure --disable-dependency-tracking CFLAGS=-maix64 LDFLAGS=-maix64
