Handy scripts:

 parse_diehardc.pl

   You can pipe the output of DiehardC to this program
   and it will compute a score that ranges from 0 to 23
   depending on how well the automaton performs in the
   tests.
   
 plot_evolution.pl

   You can pipe the GALib output file "bog.dat" to this
   program and it will show a graphic generated from the
   data of the evolution. You can also generate png images
   with it.
