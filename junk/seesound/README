I liked the idea of being able to see a little
with sound, and I wanted to test the
concept in a _very_ simple game. In the future
I would like to try something like tetris.

I found useful source code here.

I wrapped what I needed in a Python module.
src/seesound.cpp

COMPILATION

In debian, you will need the following packages:

  python-dev
  swig
  python-pygame
  (please let me know if I forgot one)

cd src
make

If you don't have the command "python2.4-config --cflags", you will have
to replace the relevant part in the Makefile using:

-I/usr/include/python2.4 -I/usr/include/python2.4 -fno-strict-aliasing -DNDEBUG -g -O2 -Wall -Wstrict-prototypes

Commands:

p --> pause
left arrow, right arrow, down arrow -> Move the cursor
up arrow -> makes the ball fall faster
q / ESC -> quit

LICENSE

The source code of this experiment is GPL
(http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html).

The source code in the file src/seesound.cpp, which
is mostly based on the code of Dr. Peter B.L. Meijer.
The page I downloaded it from says it's free software, but
it lacks of a specific license. I contacted him and he said that a link to his page is enough,
so We have an explicit permission now.

Patches are more than welcome :)
